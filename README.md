# Message Lab Theme
## What is this?
This is a custom theme for the internal Message Lab Drupal site. It is based on the core Bartik theme for now, however this will be switched to core/classy once actual theme development begins.
## What does this theme contain?
This is a bare-bones theme providing minor theme overrides and a single preprocess function to enable theme hook suggestions for core/themes/classy/templates/dataset/item-list.html.twig.
